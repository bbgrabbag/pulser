*ABOUT*
- A React Component for visually displaying when audio is playing!
- Place the icon anywhere you want in your React App!
- The interface mimics an audio graph.
- Toggle it on/off simply by providing props!

*HOW TO USE*
- `npm install --save react-pulser`
- `import Pulser from "react-pulser"`
- `<Pulser toggled = {this.audioPlaying ? true : false} />`
- Make sure to contain Pulser inside a HTML element with a specified height and width or else it may not render properly.

*FUTURE*
- More CSS customization via props (background colors, box colors, width, etc.)
